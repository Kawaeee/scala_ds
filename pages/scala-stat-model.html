                <li>Make sure you can run the logistic regression example
                    from the notes using the simple IRLS function that was provided in the directory
                    exercises/C6-GLM.

                <li>The IRLS function is illustrative rather than efficient. There are many ways in which the code could be made more efficient. We will start with the weight matrix, W. This is an n x n matrix, which is bad-news if n is large. But it's diagonal, so it could easily be represented by an n-vector. Modify the code to make W a vector rather than a matrix, and check it gives the same results as the previous version. Time it on some big problems to see if it's perceptibly faster.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="list2" style="padding-left:32px;margin-left:32px">
                <li>(optional) Google the efficient implementation of IRLS (using QR decomposition), and implement it. Check it works and that it's faster.</li>

            <ul class="list2" style="padding-left:32px;margin-left:32px">
                <li>A small library was created for fitting linear and generalised linear models, based on the code examples from this course.
                    See the <a href="https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-glm" rel="nofollow">scala-glm </a>
                    repo for further details.

            </ul>
            <ul class="list2" style="padding-left:32px;margin-left:32px">
                <li>Get this library and expand it as exercise/C6-scala-glm , and then
                    try it out and make sure you know how to use it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="list2" style="padding-left:32px;margin-left:32px">
                <li>Once you have figured out how it works, take some time to browse the source code. This is a small library with a relatively simple structure. It serves as an example of how to create a small library with a few source files and a few test files. It is a little bit bigger than the very small examples we have been focussing on in this course, but a lot smaller than a large library like Breeze, which can be a bit daunting at first.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="list2" style="padding-left:32px;margin-left:32px">
                <li>Look at how the author has (re-)structured the GLM code, and how he has implemented the IRLS algorithm.</li>

# scala_ds
- This project is for the course archivization of CSC493 - Special Topic III : Scala Language for Data Scientists.
- The course seems to have some inspiration from [darrenjw/scala-course](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course).
- Some of the exercises might not be the same as actual course work because I did some script tuning to make it work properly.

## Prerequisites
- [Java 8](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download)
- [sbt (scala build tool)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
